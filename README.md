dbin is a simple and extensible software distribution system, it is like a package manager, but without the hassle of dependencies nor the bloat, every binary provided is statically linked or otherwise self-contained, dbin itself doesn't even require a database to track installs, all operations are atomic and stateless. Dbin is particularly well-suited for embedded systems, we support both amd64, aarch64 and riscv64.

dbin can also work on systems other than Linux, but given that we don't have repositories offering binaries for other systems, we just don't release `dbin` for other systems. But, creating a repo and compiling `dbin` are trivial matters, feel free to start your own `dbin` repository :)

> Why?

"I tend to think the drawbacks of dynamic linking outweigh the advantages for many (most?) applications." â€“ John Carmack. If you are looking for more in-depth arguments, see: [dynlib - drewdevault.com](https://drewdevault.com/dynlib.html), [cat-v.ORG - Dynamic Linking](https://harmful.cat-v.org/software/dynamic-linking)

> I've seen lots of package manager projects without "packages". What is different about this one?

 There are currently ![Current amount of binaries in the repos! x86_64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/misc/assets/counter.svg) binaries in our repos. They are all statically linked.

#### Features ![pin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/misc/assets/pin.svg)
- Ability to install specific versions of binaries (by specifying the Snapshot you want to install of it)
- Ability to use user-curated repositories, as the format for the repository indexes is quite simple
  Note that a repo index for `dbin` can be in either of these formats:
  - JSON: For ease of use
  - CBOR: To optimize the time it takes to load the repo
  - YAML: Because this library is already used for the config, so, why not?
   The repo indexes can be compressed as .gz or .zst, this is specially useful for large catalogs of programs
- Hooks. `dbin` can run a set of commands or a script, whenever a binary of file with a certain extension is being installed. The user can also specify uninstall hooks
- `dbin` can work without a config, and it can also run from RAM
- No breaking changes. Old releases of `dbin` do not break, until after at least 3 releases of newer versions.
- `dbin` will survive even if the upstream repo disappears. `dbin` has a repository index that is held in its own repo. And given that the upstream binaries are held & built in GHCR, all build logs and binaries will continue to be usable/downloadable even if `pkgforge` disappears or experiences downtime
- The binaries in `dbin` are specifically filtered for `portability` (meaning, they work on older kernel versions, they work on `Musl` and `Glibc` and even weird yet wonderful systems like [AliceLinux](https://github.com/xplshn/alicelinux), [OasisLinux](https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis) or FreeBSD (with linuxlator, so that you don't have to set up an Ubuntu chroot to install a Linux web browser and be able to watch DRM content, etc)

#### What are these optional flags? ![pin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/misc/assets/pin.svg)
##### Flags that correspond to the `run` functionality
In the case of `--transparent`, it runs the program from $PATH and if it isn't available in the user's $PATH it will pull the binary from `dbin`'s repos and run it from cache.
##### `Update` arguments:
Update can receive an optional list of specific binaries to update OR no arguments at all. When `update` receives no arguments it updates everything that is both found in the repos and in your `$DBIN_INSTALL_DIR` (unless `$DBIN_REOWN=1`, dbin will not update binaries it didn't install. It won't modify symlinks either).
##### Arguments of `info`
When `info` is called with no arguments, it displays all binaries which were installed by `dbin`. When it is called with a binary's name as argument, `info` will display as much information of it as is available.
###### Example:
```
$ dbin info micro

```
##### Arguments of `list`
`list` can receive the optional argument `--detailed`/`-d`. It will display all binaries + their description
##### Arguments of `search`
`search` can only receive various search terms, if the name of a binary or a description of a binary contains the term, it is shown as a search result.
`search` can optionally receive a `--limit` argument, which changes the limit on how many search results can be displayed (default is 90) (you can also put this in your config)

## Getting Started ![pin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/misc/assets/pin.svg)

To begin using dbin, simply run one of these commands on your Linux/FreeBSD+Linuxlator system. No additional setup is required. You may also build the project using `go build` or `go install`
#### Use without installing
```
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/stubdl" | sh -s -- --help
```
##### Install to `~/.local/bin`
```
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/stubdl" | sh -s -- --install "$HOME/.local/bin/dbin"
```

### Examples of usage cases of `dbin`
#### Inside of a SH script
Whenever you want to pull a specific GNU coreutil, busybox, toybox, etc, insert a bash snippet, use a *fetch tool, etc, you can use dbin for the job! There's also a `--transparent` flag for `run`, which will use the users' installed version of the program you want to run, and if it is not found in the `$PATH` dbin will fetch it and run it from `$DBIN_CACHEDIR`.
```sh
system_info=$(wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/stubdl" | sh -s -- run --silent albafetch --no-logo - || curl -qsfSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/stubdl" | sh -s -- run --silent albafetch --no-logo -)
```
#### For creating a statically-linked & bootable rootfs using `toybox`'s `mkroot`

###### dbin uses a format for defining the repository index file that is derived from the endpoints provided by Pkgforge. During this step, we remove unportable programs and re-order variants based on their ID (smaller binaries are prioritized)

`dbin` is a package manager, which can use any repos. But it comes with a strong default selection by default.

> Hmm, can I add my own repos?

Yup, you'll need to provide a repository index, a JSON (or CBOR/YAML) (it can optionally be compressed | as .gz or .zst) file like this:
```json

# Acknowledgements

### Default repos ![pin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xplshn/dbin/master/misc/assets/pin.svg)
###### NOTE: All of them are based on external sources, except AppBundleHUB. As I'm not a package maintainer. The default repos come within the same file

- [PkgForge's repos](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories): External repository with __Portable__ programs that are _truly static, or otherwise self-contained_ using a wrapper format
   - Pkgcache: 206 <!-- PKGCACHE_COUNT -->
     - Detailed repo info: https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache
     - Package request doc: https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/pkgcache/package-request
   - Bincache: 3925 <!-- BINCACHE_COUNT -->
     - Detailed repo info: https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/bincache
     - Package request doc: https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/bincache/package-request
   - Note however that pkgforge also has dynamic (unportable) programs/packages (that only run on Debian & derivatives), `dbin` filters these out, leaving behind only the static/portable programs. These are a minority of the  programs included.
- [AppBundleHub](https://github.com/xplshn/AppBundleHUB): Only self-hosted repository: __Portable__ programs in .AppBundle format
  - 34 <!-- APPBUNDLEHUB_COUNT -->

##### Endpoints

- Lite (recommended): `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/amd64_linux.lite.cbor.zst`: .lite version doesn't include all possible fields of `dbin info`, only those which are relevant to the user & are used by `dbin`. Namely: `{Web Manifest, Sha256, Screenshots, IconURL, Provides, AppsStreamID, LongDescription}`
- NLite (default): `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/amd64_linux.nlite.cbor.zst`: .nlite is like .lite, but includes all the fields that upstream forces me to. Namely: "Web Manifest"
- Complete: `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/amd64_linux.cbor.zst`: opposite of .lite, contains all fields of the DbinItem type defined in the repository generators at [misc/cmd/dbinRepoIndexGenerators/*/generator.go](misc/cmd/dbinRepoIndexGenerators)

It makes no difference which endpoint you choose. `.lite` will be the best option for embedded hardware, unmarshalling the Complete endpoint is slow on embedded hardware, from experience, even for the MT7622 router.

NOTE: If you're using an Opteron Venus or similar ancient CPU, it may be better to use the uncompressed .lite endpoint, as the bottleneck is your CPU, not network

## Optional repos
- [AM repo](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/external/am): External repository with not-so portable programs that work only on glibc-based distros. The packages come from the [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) package manager
  - 2256 <!-- AM_COUNT -->
  - NOTE: Scrapped by pkgforge. Adapted to `dbin` format at `dbin-metadata`
  - URL: `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/AM_amd64_linux.lite.cbor.zst`

- [PkgForge Go repo](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/external/go): External repository with __Portable__ _truly static_ programs, they are the result of scrapping various sources with Go repositories and compilng them. You can read more about the process at the docs of the upstream project: https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/external/pkgforge-go
  - The binaries in this repo are Go projects that have been fetched, filtered and built automagically
  - 28027 <!-- GO_COUNT -->
  - URL: `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/pkgforge-go_amd64_linux.lite.cbor.zst`

- [PkgForge Cargo repo](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/external/pkgforge-cargo):
  - The binaries in this repo are Rust projects that have been fetched, filtered and built automagically
  - 5987 <!-- CARGO_COUNT -->
  - URL: `https://d.xplshn.com.ar/misc/cmd/1.6/pkgforge-cargo_amd64_linux.lite.cbor.zst`

### Libraries
I am using these libraries for `dbin`:
1. https://github.com/urfave/cli (v3)
2. https://github.com/hedzr/progressbar (an attractive-looking progressbar, but with a messy API and codebase. Currently the only good alternative to mpb/v8+)
3. https://github.com/goccy/go-json (index files can be .json)
4. https://github.com/goccy/go-yaml (config && index files can be .yaml)
5. https://github.com/klauspost/compress (index files can be .zst && .gz)
6. https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor (index files can be .cbor)
7. https://github.com/zeebo/blake3 (checksums)
8. https://golang.org/x/term
